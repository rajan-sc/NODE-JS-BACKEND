what did i learn today 
js 
why js
multi paradigm (meaning it can have multiple models procedural, functional, oops) and multi purpose
process = program running 
variable = bucket in which you store values allocates some memory to store
data types 
    primitive = atomic in nature 
        symbols 
        null
        undefined 
        number
        strings
        boolean 
    
    non primitive = complex and can have multiple primitive data types
        objects 
        let car = {
            name: rajan
            status : {
                health : bad,
                back : pain
            }
        }

special symbols 
\n add a line console.log("hello\nworld ")
\t add a tab space
\\ to add a backslash


arithmetic operators
logic gates/operators and coercion(js can change the data type according to its set of rules)

and && ampersand  also like true true = true 
or || pipe
not ! exclamation true become false and vice versa
also bit nor by tilde ~


typeof(10). = will give the type in strings example "numbers"
typeof(null) = object
