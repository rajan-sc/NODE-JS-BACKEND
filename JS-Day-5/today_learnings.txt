promises 
    - js objects 
    - acts as placeholder
    - when promise done we can use the result for new function or acc
    to the reject or resolve 
   let n =  new promise(function exec(resolve, reject){})


n.then(fullfilmenthandler, rejectionhandler) // both are handler fnx

microevent queue // where handler fnx go

macroevent/ callback queue where async code go to execute

after checking event loop
